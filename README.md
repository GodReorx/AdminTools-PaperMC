This is my initial Minecraft plugin, and I plan to add more features and refine the code. It was developed for version 1.21, but I'm exploring compatibility with older versions.

commands:
  atpunish:
    description: "Smites a player with a divine bolt of lightning."
    usage: /atpunish <Player>
  attpalltome:
    description: "Teleports all online players to the admin."
    usage: /attpalltome
  attptome:
    description: "Teleports a specified player to the admin."
    usage: /attptome <Player>
  attpto:
    description: "Teleports the admin to a specified player."
    usage: /attpto <Player>
  atgamemode:
    description: "Changes the game mode of a player or all players."
    usage: /atgamemode <Player|All> <Creative|Survival|Adventure|Spectator>
  atinventoryclean:
    description: "Empties the inventory of a player or all players."
    usage: /atinventoryclean <Player|All>
  atvanish:
    description: "Toggles the admin's visibility to other players."
    usage: /atvanish

The full code is available on my GitHub repository. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
